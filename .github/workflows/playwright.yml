        # headed mode, a display server is necessary. However, this job runs on
        # an Ubuntu worker without a display server.

        # https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/xenial/man1/xvfb-run.1.html,

        # processes that require a display server to run in environments where
        # one is not available.
