# Contributing

We want contributing to Blockstack UI to be enjoyable and educational for everyone. When interested in contributing to
this project, please first [create a new issue here](https://github.com/blockstack/ux/issues/new) and tell us about the
changes you are hoping to implement.

## Blockstack UI contribution

Blockstack UI is contained within a monorepo with a few other Blockstack projects. The monorepo
uses [Lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna) and [yarn workspaces](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/workspaces/).
If you are unfamiliar with those, please read about them a bit before getting started with your contributions.

### Basic steps to get started

- Fork the Blockstack UI repository on Github.
- Clone your fork to your local machine
  `git clone git@github.com:<yourname>/ux.git`
- Create a branch `git checkout -b feature/my-feature-branch`
- Run `yarn` to install all of the dependencies.
- Make sure you're working in either `packages/ui` or `packages/ui-docs` to contribute to these projects.
- Make your changes, run `yarn lint`, then push to to GitHub with
  `git push --set-upstream origin feature/my-feature-branch`.
- Visit GitHub and make your pull request.

```sh
git remote add upstream git@github.com:blockstack/ux.git
git checkout master
git pull upstream master
git checkout -b feature/my-feature-branch
```

### Locally testing the UI library

To view your changes in a live environment, we have a test application within the monorepo found at `packages/test-app`
that always uses whatever code is in the `packages/ui` directory. This is possible because most of the projects in the
monorepo are linked together via a tsconfig.json `paths` configuration. To run the test app, navigate to `packages/test-app`
and run `yarn dev`.

Additionally, when you open up a PR, the Blockstack UI package will be built and deployed within the
[CodeSandbox CI](https://codesandbox.io/docs/ci) tool, giving you the ability to test out the changes in a sharable manner.

## Documentation contribution

The documentation site for Blockstack UI is built with [next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) and written in TypeScript.
If you have not yet forked the project and installed the dependencies, please follow the instructions above.

### Usage

Next.js has a development mode that uses [Fast Refresh](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-9-4#fast-refresh) to automatically
reload the site as you make changes. To start the dev mode, simply run:

```sh
cd packages/ui-docs && yarn dev
```

You can now access the documentation site [locally](http://localhost:3000).

## Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

### Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression,
level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal
appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

### Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
  advances
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

### Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

### Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, and it also applies when
an individual is representing the project or its community in public spaces.
Examples of representing a project or community include using an official
project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting
as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of
a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

### Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the project team at design@blockstack.com. All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the project's leadership.
